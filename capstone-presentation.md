# NSS Capstone UIX Presentation Instructions

Each presentation should take approximately **7 minutes** and cover the following material:

1. Project Goals (30 seconds)
    * Pull these from your capstone proposal, GitProject and/or README. Goals should be measurable.
1. Design Brief (2 minutes) 
    * Only include slides you will actually talk about.
    * Remember, a good presnetation should not be you reading every word on each slide. Use bullet points effectively. 
2. Demo (2 minutes)
    * You don't have to demonstrate all of the functionality, just the high points.
    * Demonstrating the ability to sign-in/sign-up is a poor use of time unless there is something special about your sign-in/up process. So, have a logged-in user and be ready to go when you present.
3. Lessons Learned (1 minute)
    * This can be cathartic!
4. Question and Answer time
    * There will be questions, I promise.  Ask for questions and then pause while people gather their thoughts.


## Important points to remember:

* Use a tool to assist preparing your presentation  (Google Docs has slides).
* Within in your presentation, include a `Demo Time` slide. This will remind you to show the product even when your nerves are crazy.
* Be sure to include your email and github account at the end of presentation.
* Speak loudly and clearly, and face your audience.
* Be positive and use positive words. **DO NOT** emphasize broken parts of the program. If you notice a bug while you're presenting, just gloss past it. This is an important skill to learn for giving product demos.
* **DO NOT** insult your own work. People tend to take a person's self-evaluation at face value and you'll simply be setting people up to think your work is sub-par.
* **AVOID** referencing other student's presentations in a "well, they covered everything I had to say on my lessons learned". Your presentation should stand alone.
* Your presentation and application should be complete the evening before presentations. You are expected to have your laptop closed and your attention on the presenter during the presentations.
